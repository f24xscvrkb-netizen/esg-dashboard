<p class="muted" style="margin-top:-6px;">
  This chart normalizes controversies by company size (Market Cap) to reduce scale effects. Why it matters: Large firms tend to have higher absolute controversy counts due to scale and visibility. Normalizing by market cap helps compare controversy exposure on a more comparable basis.

The dataset includes a selected sample of companies with ESG scores and publicly reported controversy counts. The data are intended for illustrative purposes, using publicly available ESG-related indicators and simplified proxies rather than proprietary ratings.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
This dashboard aims to provide an intuitive and transparent way to explore the relationship between
corporate ESG performance and corporate controversies. Rather than presenting a definitive ranking,
the goal is to illustrate how different ESG-related indicators can be jointly interpreted.
</p>

<p>
The ESG score used in this dashboard represents a composite measure of a company’s environmental,
social, and governance performance, expressed on a standardized scale from 0 to 100. While ESG scores
are widely used in practice, they should be understood as relative indicators that depend on the
underlying methodology, data sources, and weighting schemes adopted by the provider.
</p>

<p>
Corporate controversies are used as a proxy for reputational and operational risk. In this context,
controversies refer to publicly reported events related to environmental incidents, social issues,
or governance failures. The number of controversies is not a direct measure of misconduct, as it is
influenced by factors such as media coverage, disclosure practices, firm size, and geographic exposure.
</p>

<p>
By plotting ESG scores against controversy counts, the dashboard highlights potential patterns and
trade-offs. Companies located in the bottom-right area of the chart (high ESG scores and relatively
few controversies) may be interpreted as exhibiting a more balanced ESG profile, whereas other
positions reflect different combinations of performance and risk.
</p>

<p>
This dashboard is intended as an exploratory tool rather than a definitive assessment. A professional
ESG analysis would require additional controls for firm size, sector-specific dynamics, geographic
context, time windows, and severity of controversies, as well as a comparison across multiple ESG
rating providers.

      <h3>How to read the chart</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>X-axis</strong>: ESG Score (higher values indicate better performance according to the selected metric).</li>
        <li><strong>Y-axis</strong>: Number of controversies (higher values indicate more reported events).</li>
        <li><strong>Quadrants</strong>: The ideal position is the bottom-right quadrant (high ESG score, low number of controversies).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Limitations (important)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ESG metrics are not fully standardized; different rating providers may produce different results.</li>
        <li>Controversy data are influenced by media coverage, disclosure practices, and event definitions.</li>
        <li>A professional analysis would require controls for firm size, sector, geography, and the chosen time window.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p class="muted">
My name is Shadi Treppiccione and I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Finance from the University of Rome and a Master’s degree in International Economics and Sustainable Development from the University of Groningen. I am interested in ESG analysis and sustainability metrics, with a particular focus on understanding how corporate ESG performance relates to controversies and risk indicators through transparent, data-driven approaches.    </section>
